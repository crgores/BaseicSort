# Baseic Sort

##### Another google engineer is solving strange problems again.
##### They need a program that will take a number in hex and convert this number to all bases from 16 to 2 inclusive and append to the end of hex value.

##### This program would be pretty easy to add parameters to change the range of bases we want to convert to. Because there's no standard number system that I know of past hexadecimal, I made it based off of the NUMBER_KEY length!

##### It will then count the individual digits inside the String and print out all values in order from most common to least common. If the two digits occur with same freq. the higher value has priority.
